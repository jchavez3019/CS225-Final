**Team Contract (miguel5-bheng2-jorgejc2- alpizar2)**

1. **Communication**
    1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet *Tuesdays 3-5:30pm and Sundays from 2-4pm* in person or in Zoom based on our schedules. We will have a designated record keeper who will keep track of progress and make sure we stay on track. We will be writing our tasks in a Google document. 
    1. **Assistance** The team members can ask questions through the Snapchat group chat. If there are any questions regarding code we will use Discord. If the team cannot figure out a solution to the issue will contact our project mentor. 
    1. **Respect**  All the members of the team will have a chance to speak by taking turns. If an idea is brought up we will all respectfully listen to it. If the idea would have a major impact on the project we will vote on whether or not we implement the idea. We will not insult anyone's ideas but instead we will build upon them and come up with something that everyone can agree with. 
1. **Collaboration** 
    1. **Work Distribution** After each week, we will distribute the number of tasks that need to be done. If there are not enough tasks to assign one to each member the tasks will then be distributed as pair tasks. The group will identify the strengths and weaknesses of each member and make sure that the appropriate task is given to them. If a team member has an issue and cannot complete their task they will contact the team members immediately to take the appropriate measures. 
    1. **Time Commitment** We are already meeting twice a week for about two hours so *we expect to work an additional 4 to 5 hours on our own time*. If any member has a conflict with the established meeting times they will contact the team members immediately and the team will come to a consensus and modify the meeting date. If a team member cannot get their work done they will explain their circumstance. If their explanation is reasonable the team will split up the work but if the explanation is not valid we will first discuss with the rest of the team members before notifying a staff member. 
    1. **Conflict Resolution** In the case when there is a disagreement between the team members we will use majority vote to end the disagreement. If one or two members do not complete their tasks for the week the rest of the members will complete the tasks and assign extra tasks to those members the following week. If this becomes a recurring thing the team members will notify a staff member for further guidance.We will hold each other accountable to be on time but we understand if someone is a few minutes late.
